## Introduction 
In Maji Ndogo and across the world, access to clean and reliable water sources is a fundamental aspect of daily life. This project aims to create a report to showcase insight into the Maji Ndogo water crisis to stakeholders.

## Problem Statement

A terrible drought made clean water a luxury, Every day is a struggle as people queue for hours often in vain for their share of life’s most basic necessity, A legacy of mismanagement and corruption choked off Maji Ndogo’s lifeblood, leaving its water infrastructure in ruins. But dawn followed the darkest night , This government is guided by the principles of transparency embracing a future driven by data and truth. Thus giving me a mission to help restore the flow of water in Maji Ndogo.

Data needed to inform our decisions, a sweeping water survey across provinces, towns and countless water sources will map out Maji Ndogo’s thirst.

#### Stakeholder Requirements
Our first user is a **President**.

Their user story is: As a leader of a nation  I want to understand the costs at a provincial level, and also understand what the different improvements will cost us.

1. See the key points of the survey results so I understand the overall status of water access in Maji Ndogo.
2. Know how many people are affected by water access challenges in Maji Ndogo and what those challenges are. 
3. Know how much money we will need to complete the upgrades, and where that money needs to be spent.
4. Understand this data on a national level and a provincial level.

Our second user is a **provincial leader**. 

Their user story is: As a leader of a particular province, I want to see data only relevant to my province. I need to understand the state of water access in my province, the scope of work we have to complete, and understand the financial aspects related to the improvements.

1. Total people served for each water source type in a province. 
2. Number of water sources, their type, and whether it is rural or urban.
